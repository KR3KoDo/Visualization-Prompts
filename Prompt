Create a horizontal timeline using the latest D3.js to make an interactive and visually stunning website. Design this timeline to look like a large, European dragon with head, claws, and tails. The dragon's body should curve to form the timeline's path. Make sure to use a modern flat design and psatel color palette. Translucency should be utilized to please users. The timeline shows only the most important events from the game log between GM and a player. Make that the date are abstract and indicate events. Adjust the size of each event point on the timeline by their importantness. Each event point should show a title and description when hover. Perform it step-by-step. The more important the event is, the closer it is to the dragon's body.

Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs) are narrative-driven games where players assume the roles of characters and collaboratively create stories guided by a game master (GM) or dungeon master (DM). Important events in TTRPGs can significantly impact the narrative, character development, or overall direction of the game. These events vary depending on the specific game and campaign being played. Let's use "Dungeons & Dragons" (D&D) as an example to illustrate important events in a TTRPG.
